/**
 * Shared room-open effect for {@link ./use-room} (merge-doc) and {@link ./use-stream-room}
 * (append-only). Both resolve the same crypto context the same way:
 *  - PUBLIC space: no keyring/encryptor — authorize with the invite cap (joiner) or the
 *    account cap (owner) via {@link publicSpaceAuth} and build a plain client.
 *  - PRIVATE space (E2EE): open the space keyring encryptor (cached per space; offline
 *    from the SDK pull cache) and its room client.
 * Builds on {@link useRoomOpenState} for the opening/error/offline flags + reconnect.
 *
 * The ONLY divergence is `initializeRoom`: a merge-doc owner open must seed the room doc
 * (`ensureRoomInitialized`); an append-only stream has no merge doc to seed and passes
 * `false`. Reachability is NOT reported here — building the encryptor may have used the
 * cache (offline); the caller reports it from its first fresh pull.
