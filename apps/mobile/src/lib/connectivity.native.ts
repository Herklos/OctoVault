/**
 * Online/offline signal — NATIVE (iOS/Android). Dependency-free: rather than add
 * `@react-native-community/netinfo` (a native module ⇒ rebuild + app-version bump),
 * we proxy server reachability off the SHARED SSE connection's health
 * (`onSseStatus` from {@link ./room-events-bus}). SSE up ⇒ the server is reachable.
 *
 * Two refinements over a raw mirror of `sseUp`:
 *  - Start OPTIMISTIC (`true`) — a fresh launch shouldn't flash "offline" before the
 *    stream has had a chance to connect.
 *  - DEBOUNCE the down edge: SSE momentarily drops on reconnects (and the deployed
 *    bridge is known to reconnect-loop), so only treat the device as offline after
 *    the stream has stayed down past {@link OFFLINE_GRACE_MS}. The up edge is
 *    applied immediately.
 *
 * Like the web variant, this only powers the composer hint + the flusher's retry
 * trigger — sending is attempt-driven, so a wrong boolean never loses a message.
