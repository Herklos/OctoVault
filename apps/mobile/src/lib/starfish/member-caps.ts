 * TWO tiers: the durable source of truth is the user's own synced `_spaces` doc
 * (see `registry.ts` — `caps` key), which a fresh device re-hydrates from its seed;
 * the platform kv (web localStorage / native AsyncStorage) is a fast, offline cache.
 * Both are keyed PER-USER so accounts never see each other's memberships. On
 * sign-in / account switch we hydrate the server doc OVER the local cache into an
 * in-memory map so reads stay synchronous for the hooks that consume them during
 * render (`useRoom`).

 * own synced `_spaces` doc merged OVER it (the durable source of truth). The caller
 * (session-context) reads that doc once and passes its `caps` in — so this module
 * stays pure cap-storage and the doc isn't pulled twice at startup. Merging
 * server-over-local is what makes a fresh device — empty kv, same seed — recover its
 * caps and a re-issued cap take precedence. Empty `serverCaps` (e.g. an unreachable
 * read, which degrades to `{}` upstream) leaves the local-only cache intact, so the
 * common online-device case is unaffected.
