/**
 * Shared space-open state machine for merge-doc and append-only content hooks.
 * Both open a space's crypto context the same way — resolve it over the network,
 * which can fail — so they share ONE policy here for:
 *  - `opening` / `openError` / `offline` flags,
 *  - classifying a failed open: a genuine {@link SpaceAccessError} is a hard
 *    `openError` the user must see; anything else is a connectivity failure that
 *    degrades to an `offline` shell (banner + pending states still render),
 *  - correcting the global online signal from the REAL open outcome
 *    ({@link reportReachability}) so the offline banner shows even when the native
 *    SSE-proxy flag is stuck optimistic-true,
 *  - re-opening automatically when connectivity returns.
 *
 * The hook owns no crypto/network — the caller runs its own open effect and reports
 * the result via {@link SpaceOpenState.beginOpen}/`openReached`/`finishOpening`/`failOpen`.
