/**
 * Starfish collection layout for OctoVault — a Notion/Anytype-style knowledge app
 * (NOT a chat app). ALL content lives in a GENERIC per-object family:
 *
 *   objlog / objsnap  — WAL/CRDT append-only op-log (append) + sibling LWW snapshot
 *                        for every Object with contentKind "append" (pages, boards,
 *                        tasks, …). Folded client-side by @drakkar.software/starfish-wal.
 *   objdoc            — LWW merge-doc for Objects with contentKind "merge" (record-form
 *                        custom types, file captions, …).
 *   objblob           — raw sealed binary blobs for file/image Objects.
 *   objindex          — union-merged tree index (all Objects in a space). PLAINTEXT —
 *                        invite-node titles/emoji stripped client-side before storage.
 *   objpub            — public node content (access:'public'): world-readable plaintext.
 *   objinv            — invite-only plaintext content (access:'invite'+enc:false): gated
 *                        by per-node cap via the sharing plugin, NOT space:member.
 *   typeindex         — union-merged per-space custom-type registry.
 *   spacekeyring      — space-wide multi-recipient keyring: ONE keyring per space
 *                        encrypts ALL enc nodes in that space.
 *
 * The access record lives at spaces/{spaceId}/_access (collection spaceregistry).
 *
 *   {identity}   - resolver enforces it equals the cap-bound user id
 *   {objectId} / {blobId} / {spaceId} / {nodeId} / {rendezvousId} - free path params
 *
 * Keep in sync with packages/sdk/src/starfish/paths.ts (OBJECT_COLLECTIONS)
 * AND Infra/sync/server/drakkar_sync/apps/octovault/collections.py — they are mirrors.
