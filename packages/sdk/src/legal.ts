      title: 'Overview',
      paragraphs: [
        'OctoVault is an end-to-end encrypted knowledge management app. Every page, block, board, and document is sealed on your device before it is transmitted or stored. Neither Drakkar Software nor any server operator can read your documents, notes, or boards.',
        'This policy describes what minimal information is associated with your use of OctoVault and how it is handled.',
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Your Identity and Keys',
      paragraphs: [
        'Your cryptographic identity (Ed25519 signing key, Kyber encryption key) is derived locally from a BIP-39 mnemonic seed phrase that you generate during onboarding. Your seed phrase never leaves your device and is never transmitted to any server.',
        'Profile information such as your display name and workspace avatar is encrypted before storage. The server holds ciphertext; it has no way to associate a readable identity with your key material.',
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Document Content',
      paragraphs: [
        'All documents, pages, blocks, and boards are encrypted client-side using per-space symmetric keys before being sent to the server. The server stores and delivers opaque encrypted blobs. It cannot read, index, or analyse your content.',
        'Attachments (images, files) are encrypted with the same per-space keys. File content is never accessible to the server.',
      ],
    },
    {
      title: 'Server Metadata',
      paragraphs: [
        'Basic connection metadata — document identifiers, timestamps, and the size of encrypted payloads — is necessarily visible to the server in order to route and deliver updates. This metadata does not include any document content.',
        'OctoVault does not use analytics services, tracking pixels, advertising SDKs, or any third-party library that reports usage data to external parties.',
      ],

    {
      title: 'Self-Hosted Deployments',
      paragraphs: [
        'OctoVault is designed to be self-hosted. When you run your own Starfish server, you control all infrastructure, logs, and data retention policies.',
        'If you use a server operated by a third party (a team admin, an employer, etc.), their privacy practices govern the infrastructure they control — including metadata, access logs, and backup retention. They cannot read your encrypted document content, but they do control server-level metadata.',

      title: 'Push Notifications',
      paragraphs: [
        'Push notifications, when enabled, are delivered through platform services (Apple APNs, Google FCM). By default OctoVault sends generic alerts ("New update") without decrypted content.',
        'If you enable notification previews in Settings, a decrypted preview is generated on-device and passed to the platform notification service. Drakkar Software recommends leaving previews disabled on shared or untrusted devices.',
      ],

      title: 'Data Retention',
      paragraphs: [
        'OctoVault is a persistent, append-only system by design. Documents, pages, and server-side records are retained per the server operator\'s infrastructure policy. There is no "delete account" feature — this is intentional: the append-only model is fundamental to the security and auditability of the system.',
        'You may remove OctoVault from your device at any time, which discards your local keys. Because documents are end-to-end encrypted, your local keys are the only way to decrypt stored ciphertext. Removing them renders your document history permanently inaccessible on that device — without recovery, by design.',
