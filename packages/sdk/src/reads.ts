/**
 * Per-identity READ MARKS — the epoch-ms instant each room was last read. Synced so
 * the unread badge / divider clears on EVERY one of a user's devices, not only the one
 * that opened the room.
 *
 * Two tiers, mirroring `mutes.ts`: the durable source of truth is the user's own synced
 * `_spaces` doc (a `reads` key alongside `spaces`/`caps`/`mutes`, see `registry.ts`),
 * which a fresh device re-hydrates from its seed; the platform kv (web localStorage /
 * native AsyncStorage) is a fast, offline cache. Kept as a module-level snapshot so the
 * unread provider can read it synchronously, while React consumers subscribe.
 *
 * Two differences from mutes — both because a read mark is high-frequency and monotonic
 * (it changes on every room open, and only ever advances):
 *   1. Writes are COALESCED behind a short debounce, then flushed as one whole-cache
 *      push (mutes push immediately on each rare toggle).
 *   2. Merges take the MAX per room, never overwrite — so a stale device's flush can't
 *      roll back a newer mark another device already pushed. This holds on `hydrateReads`
 *      (local un-flushed marks survive a server read) and in the `updateReadsDoc` mutator.
